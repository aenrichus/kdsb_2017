## preprocessing
Includes functions for getting the data into a single format that can be used for the 3D convolutional neural network.

## model
This is a (work in progress) 3D convolutional neural network based upon AlexNet that categorizes patients.

## regression
This is an attempt to use simpler methods, such as linear (although it should be logistic) regression on means or different bin sizes to categorize patients. Work in progress.
